# Version Management

Umbraco allows you to work with multiple versions of the same page. All previously saved pages are stored in a version history list. In this section, you will find information on how to compare versions, roll back different versions of content, or cleanup the history:

  - [Comparing Versions](Comparing-Versions/index.md)

  - [Rollback to a Previous Versions](Rollback-to-a-Previous-Versions/index.md)
  
  - [History Cleanup](History-Cleanup/index.md)
